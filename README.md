# Final-Project

This project proposes a framework for assessing citation trustworthiness in large-scale, dynamic scholarly networks. Using citation graphs as a case study, the framework aims to distinguish citations with strong structural support from those with low support or potential manipulative behavior, while capturing meaningful patterns versus random perturbations and tracking how citation structures evolve as the network grows.
The approach combines controlled graph perturbations with embedding-based link prediction.                                                                                                                            
Citation edges are randomly removed and then reconstructed using node representations to assess their structural stability. Two embedding methods, Node2Vec and GraphSAGE, are compared using complementary static structural and dynamic temporal analyses. In the dynamic method, the structural reconstruction process will be applied iteratively to cumulative snapshots, with stability scores aggregated to capture the network’s evolution, including the addition of new papers and citations. Model performance will be then validated through repeated runs with controlled artificial edge injection, and the separation between genuine and injected citation patterns is quantified using AUC-ROC, Detection Rate, and Distribution Distance metrics.
